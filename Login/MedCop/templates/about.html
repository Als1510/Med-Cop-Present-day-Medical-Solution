   <font color="BLACK"><p>Skin Diseases are one of the biggest medical issues in 21st century due to its highly complex and expensive diagnosis with difficulties and subjectivity of human interpretation. In cases of fatal diseases like Melanoma diagnosis in early stages play a vital role in determining the probability of getting cured. We believe that the application of automated methods will help in early diagnosis, especially with the set of images with a variety of diagnosis. Also, it's common knowledge that the early detection in cases of many diseases reduces the chances of serious outcomes. The recent environmental factors have just acted as a catalyst  for these skin diseases.

If a system can determine the disease in very early stage itself, the survival rate is so high that a life can be protected. This has been our motivation throughout as we developed a machine learning based predictive model to determine these diseases in the first stage itself. The problems lying underneath the health sector is not hidden anymore and therefore along with disease prediction there are other services of gps positioning, chatbot assistance and online report handling as well. The reports published by reputed institutions like American Joint Committee on Cancer clearly mention the need for identification of skin diseases in the primordial stages itself.
